# ruby-capstone-linters

## Description
This is a project which entails building a custom linter. The linter built in this project is to help beginners in javaScript check for syntax errors like forgetting the use of Var keyword when declaring variables, performing mathematical operations using floats, missing semi colon at the end of a statement, adding strings to itegers, using = sign in if conditional and forgeting to close open parenthesis.

## Built With

- Ruby 2.5.5p157/2.6.6p146
- VS Code
- RSpec
- Rubocop

- The project is now on your local machine

## How to run the project
- Open the terminal on your code editor
- cd into your project folder
- Type "bin/main" and press the enter button on your keyboard 

## How to run the rspec test

## Good and Bad code

## Bad code
- `var x = 1 + 2` missing semi colon at end of statement
- `x = 1 + 2;` missing var key word for variable declaration
- `var x = "1" + 2;` detected adding an integer to a string
- `var x = 1.0 + 2;` avoid using floats in mathematical operations
- `if(x=y);` invalid comparison operator for if condition

## Good code
- `var x = 1 + 2;` 
- `if(x==y);`
